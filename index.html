    <p><em>The "Guess the Number" website is an interactive web application that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Users can input their guesses, and the website provides real-time feedback on the correctness of their guesses, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number or exhausts their attempts. It offers an engaging and entertaining experience, encouraging users to play again and try to beat the odds. </em></p>
